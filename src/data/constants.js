      "Detection Welcome to our groundbreaking project designed to enhance avalanche safety in accident-prone areas. Combining state-of-the-art hardware and software solutions, we've created a comprehensive system to identify potential avalanche incidents and trigger timely rescue responses. In our hardware model, we leverage three crucial factors for accurate predictions: magnitude calculation, impact assessment upon hitting the ground, and consideration of temperature and barometric conditions. This multi- faceted approach enhances our ability to assess and anticipate avalanche risks effectively. Our intelligent system incorporates a threshold factor, allowing users to set specific parameters. When these thresholds are crossed, a signal is generated, triggering an automatic alert. This alert is seamlessly transmitted to rescuers through our website and app, ensuring swift and targeted response to potential incidents. Powered by React.js and map APIs, our software interface provides a dynamic alert system. In the event of an avalanche risk, the location on the map blinks, providing rescuers with real-time, visual information to assess and respond promptly. This intuitive approach enhances situational awareness, enabling rescue teams to understand and address the situation efficiently. Join us in revolutionizing avalanche safety, where cutting-edge technology meets proactive rescue measures. Together, we are creating a safer environment for those in accident-prone regions, ensuring that help is just a click away.",
